fix: reduce ESP32-CAM LED brightness to prevent glare

This commit reduces the brightness of the LED on the ESP32-CAM to make it less blinding.

- Added PWM control for the onboard LED instead of simple on/off
- Implemented a configurable brightness level (set to 50/255, ~20% brightness)
- Created helper functions ledOn() and ledOff() for consistent LED control
- Updated all LED control code to use the new PWM-based functions
- Maintained the same visual indicator patterns (slow blink for normal operation, fast blink for errors)

The LED will now be much less bright while still providing visual feedback on the device status.
